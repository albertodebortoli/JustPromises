/**
 *  AsyncOperation
 *
 *  - abstract   Operation subclass to assist with running asynchronously.
 *  - discussion A abstract subclass of NSOperation that handles the KVO reporting involved in implementing an asynchronous operation.
 *               In abject conforming to OperationObserver can be provided, which will get called as the operation transition through it's execution lifecycle events.
 *               AsyncOperation should be subclassed, not used directly. Subclasses should override start() without calling super.
 *               Subclasses are reasonable for calling didStart() and didFinish() as appropriate, to ensure state is updated and observers are informed.
